This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue is that the Tailwind directives aren't being applied to the components. This can happen even if your Tailwind configuration is correct.  For instance, the following component might not have the expected styling applied:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-500 p-4">
      <p>This should be blue!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The styles might not be applied despite correct configuration, leading to the component rendering without the expected blue background and padding.
