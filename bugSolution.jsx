The solution involves correctly configuring Tailwind's purge or content option to include the relevant component.  This ensures that the CSS generated by Tailwind contains the styles for your components. Here's an example using Next.js and the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './bugSolution.jsx' // Add the path to your component file
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

In Nuxt.js, ensure you've configured Tailwind's PurgeCSS options similarly in `tailwind.config.js` or your equivalent configuration file, making sure your component files are included within the `content` array. Ensure to rebuild your project after making these changes.
